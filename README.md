# Vrep-Vision-Sensor-cpp-Plugin
This is a Vrep Line follower example using regular API  ( CPP Plugin ) 

## Vrep Line Follower Bubble Rob example 
In this example we have made a Robot that uses Proximity Sensor to avoid obstacles ( Random cylinders in this case )
And we are using three Vision Sensors to follow a line.

## Precautions :

- I used QT to build the plugin and remember to put the files that are built ( .so files for linux or .dll for windows ) in the Folder where the V-Rep was installed.


## Here is a screenshot :
